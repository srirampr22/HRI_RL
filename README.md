## Playing with RL to enable cooperative transportation between robot and humans

<!-- 
***4DRadarSLAM*** is an open source ROS package for real-time 6DOF SLAM using a 4D Radar and 9 axis IMU. It is based on 3D Graph SLAM with (Adaptive Probability Distribution GICP) scan matching-based radar odometry estimation, a tightly inertial fusion framwork with On manifold IMU preintegration and Incremental Graph optimization. Demonstrated a significant improvement in performance, reducing relative odometry error in translation by 14% and rotation by 26% compared to the baseline radar-only odometry methods. We extensively tested our alogithm using NTU 4D Radar-centric Multi-Modal Dataset for Localization and Mapping in outdoor structured (buildings), unstructured (trees and grasses) and semi-structured environments and Dynamic traffic scenes. The yellow points represent the filtered incomming radar pcl data, the red points denote outliers and points that belong to dynamic agents/objects in the scene. the green trajectory represents the fused radar+Inertial estimated odomtery. -->
